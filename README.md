# Socrata Http Hello World #

This is a simple "Hello, World" project that listens on port 8888 and
has a single `/hello` endpoint.

Cloning this should give you a really bare-bones way to start an app.

It might make sense to add things like a `/version` endpoint and some
components common to most socrata projects in the future.
